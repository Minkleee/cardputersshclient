# cardputersshclient
A *very* simple ssh client for the m5 cardputer

## This is modified example code from m5. I am not responsible for anything but these edits.

## Why?
### •The ssh client in M5Burner is broken
## Updates? 
### •Probably not. If this is ever updated, it will only be to let users save their WiFi and ssh login details
